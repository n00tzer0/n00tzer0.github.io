# This is a cryptography challenge

Looking at the challenge we can see that we have access to a python file that we can download. Here we can see how the server operates.

## First flag
After starting the challenge server we can see that the server gives a long hex message and ask for the encryption key of it.

In the python file we can see the process how this flag 1 is encoded:

_Snippet of the code_

As you can look how the key is created you can see that it is randomly chosen from ascii_letters and digits with total length of 5 characters. So then our next step would be to brute force this key.

This can be achieved with https://www.dcode.fr/xor-cipher. 
Or at least partial recovery, as we know that the key has to start with "THM{" string.
This gets us the first flag of the challenge.

## Second flag
By getting a readable flag we can also get the key from dcode site. However, it's in hex coded so we have to convert to ASCII characters using for example: https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/

Then input the ASCII key into the terminal and receive the flag 2:
